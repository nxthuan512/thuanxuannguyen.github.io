### A BIT ABOUT ME
**Xuan-Thuan (Thomas) Nguyen** holds a B.Sc. (First Class Honors) and M.Sc. in Electronics and Telecommunications from the University of Science, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and a Ph.D. from the University of Electro-Communications (UEC), Tokyo. With a career spanning academia and industry, Thomas has built expertise in hardware design, low-power optimization, and high-performance systems.

Currently, as an IP Designer at AMD, he contributes to the PCIe controller for next-generation server, GPU, FPGA, and custom architectures, focusing on micro-architecture design, latency/power optimization, and high-quality RTL delivery. Previously, at Intel, he worked on FPGA IO subsystems and DDR5 memory controller IP, enhancing connectivity and system performance. At Tradetone Technologies, he developed FPGA-accelerated high-frequency trading hardware and explored deep learning models for stock predictions.

In academia, as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto, Thomas designed energy-efficient machine learning accelerators for brain state classification. During his Ph.D. at UEC, he collaborated with industry partners to develop hardware accelerators for in-memory database analytics, earning recognition for his research on parallel bitmap-based text processing.

Thomas thrives on solving complex hardware challenges, collaborating across teams, and mentoring junior engineers. His diverse experience across startups and established companies equips him with a unique perspective to drive innovation in hardware systems design.
